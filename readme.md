# Description

Dropdown hierarchial category in WordPress post write panel or editing screen. It makes the categories list in a better UI which enables show/hide toggle of child categories.


The idea comes from default WordPress hierarchial post categories which looks not good. Imagine that there are a lot of child categories. After selecting child category then publishing or updating a post, the arrangement seems not pretty --- the child categories moved away from its parent. This plugin tackles that situation.

Here is the screenshot after the plugin have been activated.

The down-arrow indicates category has child.
